# Python Menopause Project

This repository documents my journey learning Python while exploring the menopause business landscape in Europe, particularly Spain.

## 👩‍🔬 About Me
I’m a behavioral data scientist working in the pharma industry. During my maternity leave (until October), I’m dedicating time to:
- Upskilling in Python (I already work in R)
- Investigating menopause-related business opportunities
- Applying data science to real-world health and consumer insights

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn practical Python for data analysis and business modeling
- Understand the menopause market through open data, trends, and segmentation
- Build a scalable business concept focused on women's health
- Apply pharma behavioral insights to this new domain

## 📅 Weekly Focus (May–Sep 2025)
| Phase | Timeline | Focus | Output |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| **1. Foundations** | May | Python syntax, pandas, plotting | Jupyter notebooks on data wrangling |
| **2. Applied Analysis** | June | Data scraping, menopause trends | Mini projects: Google Trends, pricing, segmentation |
| **3. Business Modeling** | July | Personas, services, unmet needs | Market gap analysis, user profiling |
| **4. MVP Ideation** | Aug | Dashboards, virtual clinic ideas | Streamlit app or business logic |
| **5. Showcase & Polish** | Sep | Documentation, refactoring | Final GitHub portfolio |
