# Pharma Behavioral Data Science Portfolio (Python)

## Overview
Welcome to my repository where I document my journey to mastering Python for behavioral data science applications in the pharmaceutical industry. As a behavioral data scientist transitioning from R, I am building hands-on projects that focus on understanding consumer behavior in healthcare and pharma.

The goal is to leverage data-driven approaches to tackle real-world challenges—such as improving medication adherence, analyzing patient and prescriber behaviors, and uncovering market trends—while deepening my proficiency in Python.

## Why Behavioral Science in Pharma?
Behavioral science offers a unique perspective on how decisions are made in healthcare. By applying these insights, we can:
- Design interventions to promote treatment adherence.
- Develop nudges for both patients and prescribers.
- Inform strategies to enhance public health outcomes and optimize commercial efforts.
